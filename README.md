# FileCrypt

## Features:

- Asymmetric encryption

- Generate RSA key pair and encrypt(AES) private key with a password.

- Encrypt/Decrypt files recursively

- Beacuse of the asymmetric encryption nature, you can encrypt files safely in other places, without the need of carrying your private key with you!
